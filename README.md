# ETL_Mini_Project

- The crowdfunding data was extracted to create category & subcategory DataFrames
- List comprehension was used to create category & subcategory with ids within the DataFrames
- DataFrames were then exported as CSV Files

- The following columns were used in the creation of a Campaign DataFrame: cf_id	contact_id	company_name	description	goal	pledged	outcome	backers_count	country	currency	launch_date	end_date	category_id	subcategory_id
- Then we exported the CSV file

Using Option 2:
- A Contacts DataFrame was created with the following columns: contact_id	first_name	last_name	email
- Then the data was exported to a CSV file.

- The Crowdfunding_db was created within PgAdmin
- An ERD Diagram was created to analyze the relationships between the tables
- Then each CSV file was imported into their respective table in PgAdmin
- To verify a successful import, each table was examined using select from *
